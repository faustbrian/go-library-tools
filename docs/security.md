# Security Model

Threats include path traversal and symlinks, malicious YAML or JSON, command
injection, environment poisoning, unbounded process output, forged evidence,
cache contamination, service cleanup races, secret disclosure, mutable action
references, compromised release archives, and privileged pull-request code.

Controls include bounded strict decoders, repository-contained path reads,
argument-array execution, disposable task workspaces, content-addressed
evidence, digest-pinned images, exact resource ownership, redacted diagnostics,
least-privileged workflows, immutable action pins, checksum verification,
SBOMs, and provenance.

The tool executes repository tests and approved external analyzers. A repository
maintainer must therefore treat gate execution as code execution and must not
run untrusted pull-request code with secrets or write-capable credentials.
